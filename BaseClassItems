##Below is a geneirc list of items and their damage values to give consistency within the codebase ##

***SCALING***
I have based the scaling off of armor and used a type of "class" system.
My reason for this is Armor currently is hard coded and i cannot change it's values.
Below is the games armor progression (Again hard coded for now)

WOOD
STONE
GOLD, CHAINMAIL (Keep weapon damage higher than IRON)
IRON
EMERALD, MALACHITE (I'd put the weapon damage higher than DIAMOND)
DIAMOND, SAPPHIRE, PERIDOT (Yes they have the same stats; I'd change the weapons though)
TOPAZ
RUBY, TANZANITE
AMETHYST

***WEAPON SPEED***
Item types have different attach speed; an attack speed of 1 means you swing once per second.
Below is a list rated from slowest to fastest: [

AXE (0.9) (average)
SHOVEL (1.0)
PICKAXE (1.2)
SWORD (1.6)
HOE (varies, See below table for vanilla items; modded items end with amethyst at 5.8)
		Hoe Speed table: [
			Wood: 1,
			Stone: 2,
			Iron: 3,
			Gold: 1,
			Diamond: 4
		]
Take the attack speed into account when setting up weapon damage (especially the Hoe)
]

A simple way to do this is to the following formula:
Speed*Damage = DPS some examples would be:
A Diamond Sword has a damage of 5, with an attack speed of 1.6; so the formula reads: 5*1.6=8
Thus the DPS of a Diamond Sword is 8.

A Diamond Hoe has a damage of 5, with an attack speed of 4; so the formula reads: 4*4=20
Thus the DPS of the Diamond Hoe is 20.

***FINAL NOTES***
[FORMATTING] - This only applies to weapons; armor is completed
the FORMATTING of weapons goes as followed:
modded:
quotation-modname-colon-item_name-semicolon-damage-quotation
so "shinygear:amethyst_axe;7"
means the modded item amethyst_axe deals 7 damage.

vanilla:
quotation-item_name-semicolon-damage-quotation
so "DIAMOND_AXE;5"
means the vanilla item DIAMOND_AXE does 5 damage.
